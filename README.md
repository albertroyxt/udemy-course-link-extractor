# Udemy-Course-Link-Extractor
A program that extracts lecture video links of a Udemy course a user has purchased.
Born as a result of an error i faced while using Nishad's Udemy to download my course.<br>
I tried everything but it was not working so i had to improvise.

The links will be dumped into a ```Course-Link.txt```.
Feed the links to [ALAVASOFT](http://www.allavsoft.com/video-downloader-converter.html).<br>
Go to sleep, wake up with your course.<br>

Cheers!
